# Usage

## Fractal Window

 * You can zoom into and investigate any fractal that is visible on your screen either with your
   mouse or with keyboard shortcuts
 * To save a fractal for later, click either of the favourite buttons to add it to your favourites.
   To load it left click on it, to delete it right click. Any changes you make will be saved for
   when you next use the program.
 * You can export your current fractals as an image, click the Export button. You will be prompted
   to pick a size and a file to save too. Current settings will be used, if you have enough RAM
   allocated to Java, nearly any size should work.
